# Recursion

recursion is a fundamental concept in programming, the prerequisite for that is knowing how to implement a function.

## Why:

recursion is a powerful technique that offers numerous benefits for solving complex problems efficiently. Its connection to other important concepts in computer science, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and functional programming, makes it a fundamental building block of modern software development.

## What:

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself during its execution. In other words, it is a process where a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller and simpler subproblems of the same type. Each subproblem is then solved by calling the same function, and this process continues until a base case is reached, which is a simple problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.


## How:

1. Define a problem or a function that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
2. Identify the base case, which is the smallest possible instance of the problem that can be solved directly without calling the function again.
3. Write a recursive function that takes the original problem as input and breaks it down into smaller sub-problems.
4. Solve each sub-problem recursively until you reach the base case.
5. Combine the solutions to the sub-problems to obtain the solution to the original problem.
6. Return the solution to the original problem.
