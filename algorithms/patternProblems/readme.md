# Patterns 
 
printing patterns is very important , to get a good loop 

## here is a simple and basic 4 steps to print any pattern (nested loop always) :

1. the outer loop determines the number of lines.
2. the inner loop , u have to focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows.
3. print the '*' inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry [optional].
